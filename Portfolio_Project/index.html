		<h2>Software Engineer</h2>
		<h3>Here's who I am and What I do</h3>
		<p>
			With five years of experience in backend software engineering, I have developed a solid foundation in
			building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. Over the course of my career, I’ve gained extensive
			knowledge in backend technologies, including proficiency in languages such as Java, Python, and Node.js. My
			expertise extends to designing and implementing RESTful APIs, working with microservices architectures,
			and ensuring that the systems I build can handle high levels of traffic while maintaining optimal
			performance. I have hands-on experience with relational and NoSQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL,
			and MongoDB, allowing me to efficiently store and query data while ensuring data integrity and security.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’ve also worked closely with DevOps teams, streamlining the deployment process through automation,
			CI/CD pipelines, and containerization using Docker and Kubernetes. Understanding the full lifecycle
			of software from development to deployment allows me to take a proactive approach to troubleshooting and
			performance optimization. Throughout my career, I’ve been committed to writing clean, readable,
			and well-documented code, following best practices such as test-driven development (TDD) and
			ensuring robust unit and integration tests.
		</p>
		<p>
			Collaboration has been key to my success, as I consistently work alongside front-end developers,
			product managers, and other engineers to deliver high-quality solutions on time. I am comfortable
			in agile environments, adapting quickly to shifting priorities while maintaining a strong focus on
			problem-solving and delivering value to customers. My strong communication skills have allowed me to
			convey technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders effectively. As I continue
			to evolve in my career, I am passionate about exploring new technologies and methodologies to refine my
			craft and contribute to building innovative software solutions.
